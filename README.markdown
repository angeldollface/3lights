# 3 LIGHTS :bulb: :heart_on_fire:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/3lights/actions/workflows/react.yml/badge.svg)

***A small project utilizing three.js to demonstrate the usage of the Unreal Bloom Pass effect. :bulb: :heart_on_fire:***

## ABOUT :books:

I'm trying to understand and learn everything I can about three.js and Blender and one of the questions that were in my mind is how to make meshes (named objects in a scene) glow and act as light sources. Guess what? I've figured it out and this is a small demo of that.
